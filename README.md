# safer-chemicals-network

This repository contains data and code for producing a network graph visualization. It describes knowledge resources that support safer chemical substitution and the relationships between them.

The visualization itself, and more about the underlying research and design goals, can be found here: [Mapping the safer chemical substitution knowledge network](https://kaios.net/research/network).

## Technical

The data visualization is constructed in JavaScript using [D3.js](https://d3js.org). The script pulls data from the two CSV files in the `data` directory. To work with this repo locally, run a web server to serve `index.html`.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to the data as well as the JavaScript code. If you'd like me to add elements to the data, please first read about [why and how I'm doing this](https://kaios.net/research/network), and also please include references (links, etc) with your suggestions.

To contribute, use any of these methods:

* Make a pull request
* Open an issue
* Send me your suggested changes to CSV data
* E-mail me comments, if none of the above seems appropriate

Thank you.
